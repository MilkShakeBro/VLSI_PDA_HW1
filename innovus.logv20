[09/29 22:13:40     29s] **WARN: (TA-976):	Path groups asserted by the group_path constraint are considered by the software to be global in nature - they cannot be restricted to specific constraint modes. Due to this restriction, the group_path constraint is not supported directly in the constraint files which are configured in mode-specific commands such as create_constraint_mode. The current group_path entry will be ignored. You can enter the group_path constraint interactively or as part of a general command script -  where it will be interpreted as global and will be in effect for all modes.
